# NBA_HoF_Probability
[WORK IN PROGRESS]
This is an attempt to create a new model for modeling Hall of Fame Probability.
I am hoping to find some insights that may have not been explored or just identify
the highest weighing parameters in the model that I come out with.

# Next Steps
I have made a nice model with the outcomes located in regression/outcomes/outcome.csv

My ultimate goal is to try some TensorFlow Neural Networks and such because I like this choice of
project so I want to maximize my learning from it.
